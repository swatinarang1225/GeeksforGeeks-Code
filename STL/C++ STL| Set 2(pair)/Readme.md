## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Implement different operations on pairs.

### Input:
### The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases . Then T test cases follow. The first line of input contains an integer Q denoting the no of queries . Then in the next line are Q space separated queries .
### A query can be of five types 
### 1. a s x y (Adds a pair with string s and values x,y to the vector A at the end )
### 2. b (returns the size of the vector A)
### 3. c (prints space separated values of each element of the vector of pairs A)
### 4. d (sorts the pair's array with respect to the values x,y in ascending order)


Task:
The output for each test case will  be space separated integers denoting the results of each query . 

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=Q<=100
