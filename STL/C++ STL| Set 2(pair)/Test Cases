TEST CASE 1:

Example:

Input
2
5
a ga 4 5 a ra 1 2 a sh 1 1 d c
4
a geeks 10 12  a code 11 11 b c

Output
sh 1 1 ra 1 2 ga 4 5 
geeks 10 12 code 11 11


Explanation :
For the first test case
There are five queries. Queries are performed in this order
1. a ga 4 5   --> vector contents {ga,4,5} 
2. a ra 1 2    --> vector contents {ga,4,5}, {ra,1,2}
3. a sh 1 1    --> vector contents are {ga,4,5}, {ra,1,2}, {sh,1,1}
4. d               --> vector get sorted as {sh,1,1}, {ra,1,2}, {ga,4,5}
5. c               --> vector values printed as 'sh 1 1 ra 1 2 ga 4 5 ' without quotes 

For the sec test case 
There are four queries. Queries are performed in this order
1. a geeks 10 12 --> vector A has {geeks,10,12}  
2. a code 11 11   --> vector A has {geeks,10,12}, {code,11,11}
3. b       --> prints the size of the vector A ie 2
4. c       --> prints the elements of the pair of vectors as 'geeks 10 12 code 11 11' without quotes.


Note:The Input/Output format and Example given are used for system's internal purpose, and should be used by a user for Expected Output only. As it is a function problem, hence a user should not read any input from stdin/console. The task is to complete the function specified, and not to write the full code.
