## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given a string str and another string patt. Find the minimum index of the character in str that is also present in patt.

Task:
You only need to complete the function minIndexChar() that returns the index of answer in str or returns -1 in case no character of patt is present in str.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Number of distinct characters).


Constraints:
1 ≤ |str|,|patt| ≤ 105 
'a' <= stri, patti <= 'z'
