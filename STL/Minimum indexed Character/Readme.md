## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given a string str and another string patt. Find the minimum index of the character in str that is also present in patt.

Task:
You only need to complete the function minIndexChar() that returns the index of answer in str or returns -1 in case no character of patt is present in str.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Number of distinct characters).


Constraints:
1 ≤ |str|,|patt| ≤ 105 
'a' <= stri, patti <= 'z'

### Note: Code1.cpp files contain the solution to this problem using sets and Code2.cpp files contain the solution using Vector. Both the solutions are accurate and was able to pass all the provided Test Cases at geeksforgeeks.
