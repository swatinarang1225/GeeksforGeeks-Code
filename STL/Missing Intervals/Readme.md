## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given a sorted array A[] of N distinct integers from 0 to 99999. Find all the integer intervals missing from the given list.
### Note: There is always atleast 1 number missing.


Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function printMissingIntervals() which takes Integer N and an Array A[] as input and returns a array of elements with 2*x elements where x is the number of missing intervals and each pair in the array is the range missing. arr={1,3,97,100} would mean the intervals missing are 1-3 and 97-100. Suppose only the number 1 is missing ,then arr={1,1}.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)
 

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
0 ≤ Ai < 105
