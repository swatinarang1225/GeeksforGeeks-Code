## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### There are N bags with diamonds in them. The i'th of these bags contains A[i] diamonds. If you drop a bag with A[i] diamonds, it changes to A[i]/2 diamonds and you gain A[i] diamonds. Dropping a bag takes 1 minute. Find the maximum number of diamonds that you can take if you are given K minutes.


Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function maxDiamonds() which takes 2 Integers N, and K and an integer and an array A[] of N integers as input and returns the maximum number of diamonds you can take in K minutes.

Expected Time Complexity: O(NlogN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
0 <= K,A[i] <= 105
