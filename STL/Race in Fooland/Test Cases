TEST CASE 1:

Input:
N = 5, Track = 20
Li = {(1 3), (5 8), (8 13), 
           (14 15), (9 12)}

Output:
6

Explanation:
The barriers cover lanes from
 1 to 3, 5 to 8, 8 to 13, 
14 to 15 and 9 to 12. Hence, 
barriers are present on the 
lanes: {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8,
 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}.

Hence, the lanes which doesn't
come under any barriers are 
{4, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}.
So, there are 6 lanes on which
athletes can run â€“ {4, 16, 17,
    18, 19, 20}
