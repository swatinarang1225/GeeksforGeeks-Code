## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given two sequences, one is increasing sequence a[] and another a normal sequence b[], find the K-th missing element in the increasing sequence which is not present in the given sequence. If no K-th missing element is there output -1



Task:
This is a function problem. The input is already taken care of by the driver code. You only need to complete the function MissingNumber() that takes an array (a), another array (b), an element K, size of first array (n), size of the second array (m), and return the Kth missing number in an array a, if you can't find it return -1. The driver code takes care of the printing.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n + m).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(m).

Constraints:
1 ≤ n,m,k ≤ 105
1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 108
1 ≤ b[i] ≤ 103
