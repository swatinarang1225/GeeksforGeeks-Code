TEST CASE 1: 

Input: 
Stack = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
Output:
ModifiedStack = {10, 20, 40, 50}
Explanation:
If you print the stack the bottom-most element will be 10 and the top-most element will be 50. Middle element will be element at index 3 from bottom, which is 30. Deleting 30, stack will look like {10 20 40 50}.



TEST CASE 2:

Input: 
Stack = {10 20 30 40}
Output:
ModifiedStack = {10 30 40}
Explanation:
If you print the stack the bottom-most element will be 10 and the top-most element will be 40. Middle element will be element at index 2 from bottom, which is 20. Deleting 20, stack will look like {10 30 40}.
