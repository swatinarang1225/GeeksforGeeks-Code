## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given a stack, delete the middle element of the stack without using any additional data structure.
### Middle element:- floor((size_of_stack+1)/2) (1-based indexing) from bottom of the stack.

### Note: The output shown by the compiler is the stack from top to bottom.


Task:
We don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function deleteMid() which takes the stack and its size as input parameters and modifies the stack in-place.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
2 ≤ size of stack ≤ 105
