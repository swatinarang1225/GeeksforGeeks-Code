You are given two arrays A and B each containing N numbers. You need to choose exactly one number from A and exactly one number from B such that the index of the two chosen numbers is not same and the sum of the 2 chosen values is minimum. Formally, if you chose ith element from A whose value is x and jth element from B whose value is y, you need to minimize the value of (x+y) such that i is not equal to j.
Your objective is to find this minimum value.

NOTE: If not possible print "-1" without quotes.
