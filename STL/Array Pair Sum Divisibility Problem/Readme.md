## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given an array of integers and a number k, write a function that returns true if given array can be divided into pairs such that sum of every pair is divisible by k.


Task:
We don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function canPair() which takes array and k as input parameter and returns true if array can be divided into pairs such that sum of every pair is divisible by k otherwise returns false.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Space Complexity : O(n)
 

Constraints:
1 <= length of array <= 10^5
1 <= elements of array <= 10^5
1 <= k <= 10^5
