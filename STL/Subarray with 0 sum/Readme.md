## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given an array of positive and negative numbers. Find if there is a subarray (of size at-least one) with 0 sum.


Task:
We only need to complete the function subArrayExists() that takes array and n as parameters and returns true or false depending upon whether there is a subarray present with 0-sum or not. Printing will be taken care by the drivers code.
