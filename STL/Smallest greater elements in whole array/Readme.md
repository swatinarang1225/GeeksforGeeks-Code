## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given an array A of N length. We need to calculate the next smallest greater element for each element in a given array. If the next greater element is not available in a given array then we need to fill -10000000 at that index place.


Task:
This is a function problem. The input is already taken care of by the driver code. You only need to complete the function greaterElement() that takes an array (arr), sizeOfArray (n), and return an array that displays the next greater element to element at that index. The driver code takes care of the printing.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N*LOG(N)).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).

 

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
-106 ≤ Ai ≤ 106
