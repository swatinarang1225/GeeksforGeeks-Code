TEST CASE 1:

Input : arr[] = {13, 6, 7, 12}
Output : _ 7 12 13 
Explanation:
Here, at index 0, 13 is the greatest value 
in given array and no other array element 
is greater from 13. So at index 0 we fill 
'-10000000'.

TEST CASE 2:

Input : arr[] = {6, 3, 9, 8, 10, 2, 1, 15, 7} 
Output :  7 6 10 9 15 3 2 _ 8
Explanation: Here, at index 7, 15 is the greatest
value in given array and no other array element is
greater from 15. So at index 7 we fill '-10000000'.
