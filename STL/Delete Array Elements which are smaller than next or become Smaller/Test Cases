TEST CASE 1

â€‹Input : arr[ ] = {20, 10, 25, 30, 40} 
        and K = 2
Output : 25 30 40
Explanation:
First we delete 10 because it follows 
arr[i] < arr[i+1]. Then we delete 20 
because 25 is moved next to it and it 
also starts following the condition.

TEST CASE 2

Input : arr[ ] = {3, 100, 1} and K = 1
Output :  100 1
