## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Implement different operations on Priority Queue .i.e. adding element, removing element, size of priority queue, print the queue and top element of queue.


Task:
Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. For each test case, the first line of input contains an integer Q denoting the no of queries followed by Q space separated queries. 
A query can be of the following types:
1 x (Adding x to the priority queue and print the queue)
2 (Removing the element from the top of the priority queue and printing that element )
3 (Get the element at the top of the priority queue)
4 (Get the size of the priority queue)
5 (Print the priority queue) 

Note: In each case return or print -1 if priority queue is empty

Output:
For each test case, the output is according to the query Q performed and if the priority queue is empty the output is -1.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=Q<=100
