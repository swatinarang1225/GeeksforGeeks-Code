## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### You are given an array A of size N. You need to first push the elements of the array into a stack and then print minimum in the stack at each pop until stack becomes empty.


Task:
Since this is a function problem, you don't need to take any input. Just complete the provided functions _push() and _getMinAtPop(). The _push() function takes an array as parameter, you need to push all elements of this array onto a stack and return the stack. The _getMinAtPop() accepts a stack as a parameter which is returned by _push() function and prints minimum in the stack at each pop separated by spaces.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).


Constraints:
0 <= Ai <= 107
