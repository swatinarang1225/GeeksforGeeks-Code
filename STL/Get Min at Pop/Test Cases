Now, start popping elements from the stack
popping 5: min in the stack is 1.popped 5
popping 4: min in the stack is 1. popped 4
popping 3: min in the stack is 1. popped 3
popping 2: min in the stack is 1. popped 2
popping 1: min in the stack is 1. popped 1


TEST CASE 2:

Input: 
N = 7
A = {1 6 43 1 2 0 5}
Output: 
0 0 1 1 1 1 1
Explanation: 
After pushing the elements to the stack, 
the stack will be 5->0->2->1->43->6->1. 
Now, poping the elements from the stack:
popping 5: min in the stack is 0. popped 5
popping 0: min in the stack is 0. popped 0
popping 2: min in the stack is 1. popped 2
popping 1: min in the stack is 1. popped 1
popping 43: min in the stack is 1. 
            popped 43
popping 6: min in the stack is 1. popped 6
