## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given a string S and another string patt. Find the character in patt that is present at the minimum index in S.


Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function printMinIndexChar() which takes S and patt as input parameter and returns the character in patt that is present at the minimum index in S. If not possible returns "$".
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(max(|str|, |patt|))
Expected Auxilary Space: O(K) where K <= 26
 

Constraints:
1 ≤ |S|, |patt| ≤ 104
