## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given two lists V1 and V2 of sizes n and m respectively. Return the list of elements common to both the lists and return the list in sorted order. Duplicates may be there in the output list.


Task:
This is a function problem. You need to complete the function common_element that takes both the lists as parameters and returns a list of common elements.

Constraints:
1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105
1 ≤ Vi ≤ 105
