## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Iterators are used to iterate over vectors, maps, sets etc. Here we will learn to iterate over a vector from begin to end.
### You are given a vector V of size n. You need to print its elements.


Task:
Since this is a function problem, you don't need to take any input. Just complete the function iter() that takes two iterators as parameters, i.e., starting and ending iterators. In a new line, print the required output.

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 107
0 <= Vi <= 107
