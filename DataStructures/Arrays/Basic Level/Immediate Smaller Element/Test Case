TEST CASE 1:

Input:
N = 5
Arr[] = {4, 2, 1, 5, 3}
Output:
2 1 -1 3 -1
Explanation: Array elements are 4, 2, 1, 5 
3. Next to 4 is 2 which is smaller, so we
print 2. Next of 2 is 1 which is smaller,
so we print 1. Next of 1 is 5 which is
greater, so we print -1. Next of 5 is 3
which is smaller, so we print 3.  Note
that for last element, output is always 
going to be -1 because there is no element
on right.

TEST CASE 2:

Input:
N = 6
Arr[] = {5, 6, 2, 3, 1, 7}
Output:
-1 2 -1 1 -1 -1
Explanation: Next to 5 is 6 which is
greater, so we print -1.Next of 6 is 2
which is smaller, so we print 2. Next
of 2 is 3 which is greater, so we
print -1. Next of 3 is 1 which is
smaller, so we print 1. Next of 1 is
7 which is greater, so we print -1.
Note that for last element, output is
always going to be -1 because there is
no element on right.
