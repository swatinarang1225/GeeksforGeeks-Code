## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given an integer array Arr of size N. For each element in the array, check whether the right adjacent element (on the next immediate position) of the array is smaller. If next element is smaller, update the current index to that element. If not, then  -1.

TASK
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function immediateSmaller() which takes the array of integers arr and n as parameters. You need to change the array itself.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 107
1 ≤ Arr[i] ≤ 105
