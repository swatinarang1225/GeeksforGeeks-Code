## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given an array of N integers. Find the first element that occurs at least K number of times.

TASK
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function firstElementKTime() which takes the array A[], its size N, and an integer K as inputs and returns the required answer. If the answer is not present in the array, return -1.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 104
1 <= K <= 100
1<= A[i] <= 200
