## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Implement a Queue using an Array. Queries in the Queue are of the following type:
#### (i) 1 x   (a query of this type means  pushing 'x' into the queue)
#### (ii) 2     (a query of this type means to pop element from queue and print the poped element)

TASK

You are required to complete the two methods push() which take one argument an integer 'x' to be pushed into the queue and pop() which returns a integer poped out from othe queue. If the queue is empty, it should return -1 on a pop operation. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(1) for both push() and pop().
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1) for both push() and pop().

Constraints:
1 ≤ Q ≤ 105
1 ≤ x ≤ 105
