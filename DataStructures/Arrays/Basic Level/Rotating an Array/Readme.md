## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given an array of size N. The task is to rotate array by D elements where D ≤ N.

TASK:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function leftRotate() which takes the array of integers arr[], its size n and d as input parameters and rotates arr[] in-place without using any extra memory.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ Arr[i] ≤ 1000
0 ≤ D ≤ N
