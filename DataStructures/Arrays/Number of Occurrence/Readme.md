## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given a sorted array Arr of size N and a number X, you need to find the number of occurrences of X in Arr.

TASK
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function count() which takes the array of integers arr, n, and x as parameters and returns an integer denoting the answer.
If x is not present in the array (arr) then return 0.

Expected Time Complexity: O(logN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ Arr[i] ≤ 106
1 ≤ X ≤ 106
