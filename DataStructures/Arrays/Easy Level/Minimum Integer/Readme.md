## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### You are given an array A of size N. Let us denote S as the sum of all integers present in the array. Among all integers present in the array, find the minimum integer X such that S ≤ N*X.

TASK

The task is to complete the function minimumInteger() which takes an integer N and an integer array A as input parameters and returns the minimum integer which satisfies the condition.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤  N ≤ 105
1 ≤  Ai ≤ 109
