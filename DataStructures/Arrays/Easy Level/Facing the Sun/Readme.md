## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given an array H representing heights of buildings. You have to count the buildings which will see the sunrise (Assume : Sun rise on the side of array starting point).

### Note : Height of building should be strictly greater than height of buildings in left in order to see the sun.

TASK

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function countBuildings() which takes the array of integers h and n as parameters and returns an integer denoting the answer.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 106
1 ≤ Hi ≤ 108
