## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given an array arr[] of size n, find the first repeating element. The element should occur more than once and the index of its first occurrence should be the smallest.

#### Note:- The position you return should be according to 1-based indexing. 


TASK

You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function firstRepeated() which takes arr and n as input parameters and returns the position of the first repeating element. If there is no such element, return -1.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxilliary Space: O(n)

 

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 106
0 <= Ai<= 106
