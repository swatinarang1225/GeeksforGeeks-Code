## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given an array A of n positive numbers. The task is to find the first equilibrium point in an array. Equilibrium point in an array is a position such that the sum of elements before it is equal to the sum of elements after it.

#### Note: Return equilibrium point in 1-based indexing. Return -1 if no such point exists. 

TASK:

The task is to complete the function equilibriumPoint() which takes the array and n as input parameters and returns the point of equilibrium. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 109
