TEST CASE 1:

Input: 
n = 5 
A[] = {1,3,5,2,2} 
Output: 
3 
Explanation:  
equilibrium point is at position 3 as sum of elements before it (1+3) = sum of elements after it (2+2). 

TEST CASE 2:

Input:
n = 1
A[] = {1}
Output: 
1
Explanation:
Since there's only element hence its only the equilibrium point.
