## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given an unsorted array arr[] of size N. Rotate the array to the left (counter-clockwise direction) by D steps, where D is a positive integer.


TASK
You need not print or read anything. You need to complete the function rotateArr() which takes the array, D and N as input parameters and rotates the array by D elements. The array must be modified in-place without using extra space. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 <= N <= 106
1 <= D <= 106
0 <= arr[i] <= 105
