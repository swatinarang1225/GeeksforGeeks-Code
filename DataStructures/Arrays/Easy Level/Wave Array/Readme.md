## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given a sorted array arr[] of distinct integers. Sort the array into a wave-like array(In Place). In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that arr[1] >= arr[2] <= arr[3] >= arr[4] <= arr[5].....
### If there are multiple solutions, find the lexicographically smallest one.

#### Note:The given array is sorted in ascending order, and you don't need to return anything to make changes in the original array itself.

TASK:

The task is to complete the function convertToWave(), which converts the given array to a wave array.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 106
0 â‰¤ arr[i] â‰¤107
