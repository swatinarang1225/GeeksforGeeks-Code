## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given an unsorted array arr[] of size n having both negative and positive integers. The task is place all negative element at the end of array without changing the order of positive element and negative element.

TASK

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function segregateElements() which takes the array arr[] and its size N as inputs and store the answer in the array arr[] itself.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)
 
Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 106
-109 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 109
