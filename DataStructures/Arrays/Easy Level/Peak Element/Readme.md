## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### An element is called a peak element if its value is not smaller than the value of its adjacent elements(if they exists). Given an array arr[] of size N, Return the index of any one of its peak elements.
#### Note: The generated output will always be 1 if the index that you return is correct. Otherwise output will be 0.
