## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### An element is called a peak element if its value is not smaller than the value of its adjacent elements(if they exists). Given an array arr[] of size N, Return the index of any one of its peak elements.
#### Note: The generated output will always be 1 if the index that you return is correct. Otherwise output will be 0. 

TASK:

You don't have to read input or print anything. Complete the function peakElement() which takes the array arr[] and its size N as input parameters and return the index of any one of its peak elements.

Can you solve the problem in expected time complexity?

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(log N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ A[] ≤ 106
