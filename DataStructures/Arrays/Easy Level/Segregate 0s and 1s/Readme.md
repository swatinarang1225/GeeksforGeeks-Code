## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given an array of length n consisting of only 0's and 1's in random order. Modify the array in-place to segregate 0s on the left side and 1s on the right side of the array.

TASK

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function segregate0and1() which takes arr[] and n as input parameters and modifies arr[] in-place without using any extra memory.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 106
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1
