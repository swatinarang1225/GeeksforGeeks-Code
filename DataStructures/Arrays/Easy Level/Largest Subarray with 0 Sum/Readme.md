## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given an array having both positive and negative integers. The task is to compute the length of the largest subarray with sum 0.


TASK:
You just have to complete the function maxLen() which takes two arguments an array A and n, where n is the size of the array A and returns the length of the largest subarray with 0 sum.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
-1000 <= A[i] <= 1000, for each valid i
