## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given an array of distinct elements which was initially sorted. This array may be rotated at some unknown point. The task is to find the minimum element in the given sorted and rotated array. 

TASK

The task is to complete the function minNumber() which takes the array arr[] and its starting and ending indices (low and high) as inputs and returns the minimum element in the given sorted and rotated array.

Expected Time Complexity: O(LogN).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(LogN).

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 107
1 <= arr[i] <= 107
