## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given a singly linked list consisting of N nodes. The task is to remove duplicates (nodes with duplicate values) from the given list (if exists).
#### Note: Try not to use extra space. The nodes are arranged in a sorted way.

TASK
The task is to complete the function removeDuplicates() which takes the head of input linked list as input. The function should remove the duplicates from linked list and return the head of the linkedlist.

Expected Time Complexity : O(N)
Expected Auxilliary Space : O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= Number of nodes <= 105
