## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given an array of N integers, and an integer K, find the number of pairs of elements in the array whose sum is equal to K.

TASK:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function getPairsCount() which takes arr[], n and k as input parameters and returns the number of pairs that have sum K.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= K <= 108
1 <= Arr[i] <= 106
