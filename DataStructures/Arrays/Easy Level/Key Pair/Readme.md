## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given an array Arr of N positive integers and another number X. Determine whether or not there exist two elements in Arr whose sum is exactly X.



TASK:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function hasArrayTwoCandidates() which takes the array of integers arr, n and x as parameters and returns a boolean denoting the answer.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ Arr[i] ≤ 105
