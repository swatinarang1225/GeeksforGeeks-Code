## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given an array A[] of N positive integers which can contain integers from 1 to P where elements can be repeated or can be absent from the array. Your task is to count the frequency of all elements from 1 to N.
#### Note: The elements greater than N in the array can be ignored for counting and do modify the array in-place.

TASK:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function frequencycount() that takes the array and n as input parameters and modify the array itself in place to denote the frequency count of each element from 1 to N. i,e element at index 0 should represent the frequency of 1, and so on.


Can you solve this problem without using extra space (O(1) Space)?


Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ P ≤ 4*104 
1 <= A[i] <= P
