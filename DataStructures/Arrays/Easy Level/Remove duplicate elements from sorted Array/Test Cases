TEST CASE 1:

Input:
N = 5
Array = {2, 2, 2, 2, 2}
Output: 2
Explanation: After removing all the duplicates only one instance of 2 will remain i.e. {2} so modify array will contains 2 at first position and you should return 1 after modify the array.


TEST CASE 2:

Input:
N = 4
Array = {1, 2, 2, 4}
Output: 1 2 4
Explation: After removing all duplicates modify array will contains {1, 2, 4} at first 3 positions so you should return 3 after modify the array.
