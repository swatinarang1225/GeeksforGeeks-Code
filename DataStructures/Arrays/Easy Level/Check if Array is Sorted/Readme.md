## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given an array arr[] of size N, check if it is sorted in non-decreasing order or not. 

TASK

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function arraySortedOrNot() which takes the arr[] and N as input parameters and returns a boolean value (true if it is sorted otherwise false).

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 106
- 109 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 109
