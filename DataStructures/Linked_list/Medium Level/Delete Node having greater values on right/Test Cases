TEST CASE 1:

Input:
LinkedList = 12->15->10->11->5->6->2->3
Output: 15 11 6 3
Explanation: Since, 12, 10, 5 and 2 are
the elements which have greater elements
on the following nodes. So, after deleting
them, the linked list would like be 15,
11, 6, 3.

TEST CASE 2:

Input:
LinkedList = 10->20->30->40->50->60
Output: 60
Explanation: All the nodes except the last
node has a greater value node on its right,
so all the nodes except the last node must
be removed.
