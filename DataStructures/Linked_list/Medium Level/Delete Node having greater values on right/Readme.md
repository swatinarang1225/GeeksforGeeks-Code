## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given a singly linked list, remove all the nodes in the list which have any node on their right whose value is greater. (Not just immidiate Right , but entire List on the Right)


TASK:

The task is to complete the function compute() which should modify the list as required and return the head of the modified linked list. The printing is done by the driver code,

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ size of linked list ≤ 105
1 ≤ element of linked list ≤ 105
Note: Try to solve the problem without using any extra space.
