TEST CASE 1:

Input:

Output: 0
Explanation: According to the given edges, all 
nodes can be reached from nodes from 0, 1 and 2. 
But, since 0 is minimum among 0,1 and 2, so 0 
is the output.

TEST CASE 2:

Input: 

Output: -1
Explanation: According to the given edges, 
no vertices are there from where we can 
reach all vertices. So, output is -1.
