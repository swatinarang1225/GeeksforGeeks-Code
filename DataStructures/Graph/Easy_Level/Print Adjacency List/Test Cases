TEST CASE 1:

Input:
V = 5, E = 7
edges = {(0,1),(0,4),(4,1),(4,3),(1,3),(1,2),(3,2)}

Output: 
{{1,4}, 
 {0,2,3,4}, 
 {1,3},
 {1,2,4},
 {0,1,3}}
Explanation:
Node 0 is connected to 1 and 4.
Node 1 is connected to 0,2,3 and 4.
Node 2 is connected to 1 and 3.
Node 3 is connected to 1,2 and 4.
Node 4 is connected to 0,1 and 3.

TEST CASE 2:

Input:
V = 4, E = 3
edges = {(0,3),(0,2),(2,1)}


Output: 
{{2,3} 
 {2}, 
 {0,1} 
 {0}}
Explanation:
Node 0 is connected to 2 and 3.
Node 1 is only connected to 2.
