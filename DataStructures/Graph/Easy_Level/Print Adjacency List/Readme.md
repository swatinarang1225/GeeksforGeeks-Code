## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given an undirected graph with V nodes and E edges, create and return an adjacency list of the graph. 0-based indexing is followed everywhere.

TASK:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function printGraph() which takes the integer V denoting the number of vertices and edges as input parameters and returns the list of list denoting the adjacency list.

Expected Time Complexity: O(V + E)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(V + E)

Constraints:
1 ≤ V, E ≤ 105
