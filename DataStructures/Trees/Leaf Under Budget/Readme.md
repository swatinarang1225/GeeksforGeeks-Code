## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given a binary tree and a budget. Assume you are at the root of the tree(level 1), you need to maximise the count of leaf nodes you can visit in your budget if the cost of visiting a leaf node is equal to the level of that leaf node.

TASK:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function getCount() which takes root node of the tree and a integer denoting the budget as input parameters and returns an integer denoting the count of visited leaf nodes of the tree.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
1<=N<=105
1<=budget<=104
