Here in this code the provided information is below:
  1. The binary Tree
  2. key or item that need to be inserted at the first possible place

For this type of Insertion, I have used an iterative method to traverse the nodes of the tree to check the availabilty of the left and right child of the particular node.If we find the left Child empty we will add the new node with the provided key.Else we will check for thr right child and if find empty then add a new node as a right child with given Key as data.
