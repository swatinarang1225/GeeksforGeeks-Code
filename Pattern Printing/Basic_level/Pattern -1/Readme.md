## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### Given a number N, identify the pattern from  the given Examples and print the Output.

TASK:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findThePattern() which takes an Integer N as input and returns a vector of strings where each line represents lines of the pattern. For example, if N = 4, the vector v = {"ABCD", "E$$F", "G$$H", "IJKL"}.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

 

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 6
