## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### For a given value N, denoting the number of Characters starting from the A, print reverse character bridge pattern.

TASK:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function revCharBridge() which takes an Integer N as input and returns a vector of strings where each line represents lines of the pattern. For example, if N = 3, the vector v = {"ABCBA", "AB BA", "A   A"}.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
2 <= N <= 26
