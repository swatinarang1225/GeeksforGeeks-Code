## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### The jet's speed is changed after every mile covered on it's runway. It follows a specific pattern for the speed. Starting from 1 it goes like 1, 7, 16, 21, 81, 63, 256 . . .  and so on. Given N find its speed after Nth mile.

TASK:

You don't need to read or print anyhting. Your task is to complete the function Nth_mileSpeed() which taked N as input parameter and returns jet's speed after Nth mile.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 60
